Generating Frequent Pattern-Growth
To generate frequent pattern-growth, we do the following:

In the first scan of the database, we try to find the minimum support of itemsets.
If the frequency of items is less than the specified minimum support, we simply delete them from the database.
The set of frequent items is sorted in the descending order of support.
Then, an FP-tree is constructed.
The initial node of the FP-tree is called the root node. It is labeled null.
The items in the transactions are processed when the node is created.
Whenever we try to pass the itemset, we can create a child node and expand it if the itemset follows the root node.
If a branch encounters a common prefix for the existing path, we increment the value of the root node.
We repeat the process for each itemset until we reach the end of the itemsets in the transaction.
To facilitate tree traversal, we build an item header table so that each item points to occurrences in thetree via a chain of node-links.
